# wrap
wrap is an implementation of the Four-Step model of traffic demand prediction written in Java. This project was originally created as an implementation of Dial's static traffic assignment Algorithm B, as part of a course project for the Transportation Network Analysis (CE 392C) course at the University of Texas at Austin. Work has since been underway to expand this package to cover the remaining steps, namely trip generation, distribution, and mode choice. This project continues to be under active development as of 2019-04.

## Original goal statement (2017)
This project implements Algorithm B, as presented by Dial (2006) in order to create a solver for the Traffic Assignment Problem as defined by Beckmann et al. (1956). The aim for this project is to implement a time- and space-efficient framework of Algorithm B which can be studied, extended, and executed properly. We also aim to provide quality documentation and testing of our code, in order that this project will serve as a good exercise in practicing proper software development techniques.
